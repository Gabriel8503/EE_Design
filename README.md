# ⚡ EE_Design

Welcome to my Electrical Engineering design repository. This space is dedicated to documenting my journey as I build, test, and refine custom circuitry—from concept to production.

## 📘 Purpose

This repo will serve as a running log of my EE projects, experiments, and useful resources I reference or study during the process.

## 🛠️ Current Focus

- Designing microcontroller-based boards from scratch  
- Understanding and applying best practices in PCB design  
- Learning embedded systems and firmware workflows  

## 📚 Resources

Here's a curated list of resources that I'm currently using:

- **Getting to Blinky 5.0**  
  *(A foundational project series for FPGA and PCB design by Chris Gammell)*

- **Building a Microcontroller Board from Scratch**  
  [PDF Guide Link](https://attachments.convertkitcdnm.com/131144/1861af26-d50b-4f31-98b9-467ac304307f/Building-a-Microcontroller-Board-from-Scratch.pdf?utm_campaign=Landing%20Page%20or%20Form%20-%20939283&utm_medium=email&utm_source=convertkit)
