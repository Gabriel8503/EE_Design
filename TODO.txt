PCB DESIGN ROADMAP TODO LIST

PHASE 1: Fundamentals and Basic Projects (7/1/2025-present)
- [ ] Complete a simple LED flasher or 555 timer PCB project using KiCad
- [ ] Learn schematic capture, netlist generation, and PCB layout in KiCad
- [ ] Master basics: trace width, pad size, component selection, DRC
- [ ] Order and solder your first custom PCB from a fab like JLCPCB or OSHPark
- [ ] Read 'The Art of Electronics' and KiCad official documentation
- [ ] Join KiCad forums and Reddit communities for peer feedback

PHASE 2: Intermediate Design Challenges
- [ ] Design a custom microcontroller breakout board (e.g., STM32 or Arduino)
- [ ] Implement mixed-signal design: ADCs/DACs and sensors with MCUs
- [ ] Add ground and power planes, plan multi-layer stackups
- [ ] Learn decoupling, stitching vias, and routing high-current traces
- [ ] Use IPC-2221 design rules for trace width/spacing
- [ ] Take an intermediate PCB design course (Udemy, Philâ€™s Lab)

PHASE 3: Advanced High-Speed and Complex Systems
- [ ] Design a high-speed FPGA board or data acquisition system
- [ ] Use differential pair routing and matched-length traces
- [ ] Simulate trace impedance using Saturn PCB Toolkit or calculators
- [ ] Practice EMI mitigation: ground pours, shielding, return paths
- [ ] Study 'High-Speed Digital Design' by Johnson & Graham and SI texts
- [ ] Reference application notes from TI, Analog Devices, Microchip

PHASE 4: Aerospace & Communication Systems Specialization
- [ ] Design a CubeSat payload board or ruggedized RF communication module
- [ ] Learn aerospace-grade stackups, heavy copper, and high-Tg laminates
- [ ] Use MIL-spec connectors, derated components, and thermal management
- [ ] Study IPC Class 3 rules, MIL-STD guidelines, and AS9100/478N specs
- [ ] Implement radiation-hard design and environmental tolerances
- [ ] Consider IPC Military & Aerospace training for certification

ONGOING:
- [ ] Learn/maintain Git version control for all projects
- [ ] Participate in design reviews and DFM checks
- [ ] Iterate with real-world builds, testing and soldering each design
- [ ] Post on forums and engage in PCB reviews for feedback and improvement
